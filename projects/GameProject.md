summary: "A Game Design Project that I and a group of people created for ICS 485 called \"Pō an Abyss\""
---

Simultaneously worked on another game project for my Game Design class using Unity Game Engine. 

### The Process
The process for designing a game is no simple task and since this is my first time designing a game with no prior experience, there was a lot of doubt and questions that I had running through my mind. The first milestone that we had to work towards was giving birth to a game idea that we would work towards over the course of the semester. I grouped up with a few other classmates and we discussed what we wanted to work. There were a lot of ideas that we had and eventually decided on a vertical platform game as the initial point. The second milestone for this project was storyboarding and deciding how the game will flow and how players will experience the game from their point of view.

  <h3>Pivoting towards a different approach</h3>
</div>
There were a lot of initial plans for the game, but due to time constraints and not really having a concrete idea for the game, we pivoted to a different concept of the game which is a simple obstacle course game that the player will have to traverse through to eventually reach the end of the game.

### Milestone 1
The original game idea was a combat-heavy vertical platformer where players descended into a hostile abyss to fight monsters, manage limited resources, and uncover relics tied to the game’s backstory. Combat required strategy and precision, while the environment grew more hostile the deeper the player went.

<p><strong>Key gameplay features included:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>One-way descent physics (no climbing back up)</li>
  <li>Platforms with unique properties (crumbling, slippery, disappearing)</li>
  <li>Adaptive horror elements (stronger enemies, darker environments)</li>
  <li>Environmental storytelling (relics, journals, ruins)</li>
  <li>Resource and stamina management</li>
  <li>Boss encounters and loot-based progression</li>
</ul>

<p>Thematically, the descent into the abyss symbolized the characters’ desire for forbidden knowledge. The game was structured with skills-based progression</, a mysterious narrative, and culturally inspired symbolism.</p>


### Milestone 2
<p>As development continued, we shifted the game’s tone from horror toward mystery and cultural exploration. The new narrative focuses on Kai, the main character, who gets pulled into the abyss after discovering a glowing <em>‘umeke</em> on a reef. He awakens in an overgrown cave where a spirit guide offers cryptic dialogue and a tutorial.</p>

<p>The descent is now centered on collecting sacred artifact fragments and escaping the cursed abyss. Each level builds on the story, revealing fragments of the past and elements of Hawaiian mythology. The mystery of why Kai was chosen—and the nature of the abyss—is left for the player to uncover through exploration.</p>

<p>Storyboard Highlights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kai sees something glowing in the distance</li>
  <li>He picks up the <em>‘umeke</em></li>
  <li>The abyss entrance activates</li>
  <li>He’s pulled inside</li>
  <li>Lands in a mossy cavern</li>
  <li>A spirit guide teaches him the controls</li>
</ul>

<p>The visual aesthetic now includes glowing flora, ancient ruins, and echoes of past explorers. We were inspired by the ambiance of <em>Hollow Knight</em>, combining it with traditional Hawaiian drums like <em>Kumulipo</em> and <em>E Pua Ana Ka Makani</em> to create a spiritual, immersive tone.</p>

<p>Milestone Goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Finalize storyboarding and tutorial sequence</li>
  <li>Build core mechanics over spring break</li>
  <li>Deliver a playable prototype before the April 11th demo</li>
  <li>Polish and refine based on feedback afterward</li>
</ul>

### My Task
My task for this project was the title screen UI and character animations. The design of the title screen was done through Canva and followed a simple tutorial on scene management and embedding music into the scene. The character animations were the toughest part since I initially I had plans on creating my own sprite sheet but since that was too ambitious, I decided on finding an asset from a store. There were a lot of mishaps with the chaarcter from floating in the air, incorrect physics, and the animations going in different directions because of logic errors in the code.

### Experience with Unity
Using a new software can be challenging and daunting, but over time I got used to using the game engine through tutorials and constantly trying to fix my own errors. There were countless times where I would go in circles and wonder why something was not working, but when it eventually worked, there was a sigh of relief and a moment of satisfaction. Although I have gotten used to using Unity, I did not enjoy how badly it ran on my computer since I only have 8GB of ram and the requirements for Unity are on the higher scale. If I had to develop a game again, then I would use Godot since I have heard from other people that it is easier to use. Despite the struggles, this project taught me a lot of not just about Unity, but about teamwork, patience, and problem-solving in real time.
