### Experience with Unity
Using a new software can be challenging and daunting, but over time I got used to using the game engine through tutorials and constantly trying to fix my own errors. There were countless times where I would go in circles and wonder why something was not working, but when it eventually worked, there was a sigh of relief and a moment of satisfaction. Although I have gotten used to using Unity, I did not enjoy how badly it ran on my computer since I only have 8GB of ram and the requirements for Unity are on the higher scale. If I had to develop a game again, then I would use Godot since I have heard from other people that it is easier to use. Despite the struggles, this project taught me a lot of not just about Unity, but about teamwork, patience, and problem-solving in real time.
