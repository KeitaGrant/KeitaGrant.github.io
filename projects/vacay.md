This was a short assignment that I did for my ICS 212 class. The objective for this assignment was to utilize custom functions and in this case, I made functions that multiplied numbers and either returned a message displaying if the input was correct or incorrect. The main goal of this assignment was to practice using Unix as well as creating a makefile to make an executable program. 


Here is the example output of the code displayed in the terminal:
