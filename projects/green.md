PC: Global Preservation Initiative


This event was a beach cleanup and mini restoration effort organized by the Global Preservation Initiative, a group dedicated to environmental conservation and sustainability. 
The event took place on Sand Island, a well-known area that many of us have visited. A lot of the beauty we see in nature is often taken for granted, and unfortunately, many people 
donâ€™t realize the long-term effects of neglecting these environments. Trash, debris, and other pollutants accumulate over time, disrupting the ecosystem and harming wildlife.

For this particular event, my role involved two key tasks: repainting structures and picking up trash along the beach. 
The cleanup portion of the event involved walking along the beach and collecting litter that has been left by homeless people or careless individuals.
The repainting aspect of this event was to give a fresh new coat to parking structures that were worn down by the weather and age.

Overall, this experience was very rewarding as it made me see how much of an impact taking care of the community that we live in is and why it is important to care for the planet that we 
and our future generations will live in.
