summary: "This semester, I had the opportunity to help create a game called "Poke the Hornet's Nest""
---

Unity is a game engine developed by Unity technologies which is used to create 2D/3D/AR games and experiences. During this semester, I had the chance to collaborate with other students in the Game Development club to create a game.

### The Process
As with any project, starting off with a plan on something as big as creating a game requires thoughtful planning. At the beginning of the semester, there was an opportunity for students to group together and brainstorm ideas on what the game should be. Each group consisted of coders and artists so that we could bounce ideas off each from an artistic and coding perspective. The brainstorming process eventually led to a Game Pitch where each group presented their idea on which game the club should create. Since the theme for this semester was 'territorial', we each tried to center our ideas on what defines territory. There were many interesting ideas for games (The game pitch for my group was an ant simulator game). Eventually, we took a vote on the most interesting idea which was a game about a bee and wasps. 

### Fleshing out the Idea


### My Task
After fleshing out the game idea, we each assigned ourselves a task on the game project. The task that I chose to take upon myself was the level design for floor 2 and Boss Phase 2.
