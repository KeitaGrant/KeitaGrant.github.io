Over the course of the semester, we learned how to build websites and comprehensively study what it means to develop software.

### The Idea
ArtHub is a web application designed to connect artists of all levels: amateurs, students, and professionals—through a single platform where they can showcase their work, collaborate on projects, and sell their art. The app is built for the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa community, particularly students in art courses looking for visibility and creative networking.

### My Task

This is the Events page that I developed for the ArtHub application. The original plan was to implement a dynamic form that would allow administrators to create, edit, and delete events directly from the interface. However, due to time constraints and shifting priorities during the final development phase, we were unable to fully implement that feature. Despite this, the page still displays a rotating list of upcoming art events and contributes to the platform's goal of community engagement.

In addition to building the Events page, I also created Playwright test scripts for various parts of the application. These scripts were used to automate UI testing and ensure that key features—such as navigation, user login, uploading artwork, and viewing profiles—functioned as expected. This helped us catch bugs early and verify that core functionality remained intact throughout the development process.

Working on this project taught me a lot about real-world collaboration, time management, and balancing ideal features with deliverable outcomes. It was my first time using Playwright and integrating automated testing into a group workflow, and I gained a solid understanding of how testing frameworks can be used to maintain reliability across updates.


### Lessons Learned and the use of AI
<p>Through iterative development and real-time feedback, the team identified areas for improvement and adjusted the application to better meet user expectations. I encountered several challenges throughout the development of the ArtHub project, especially when working with Supabase. As this was my first time using Supabase, I found it to be both tedious and highly sensitive. Simple mistakes—like incorrect table configuration or missing environment variables—often led to confusing errors that were difficult to trace. The learning curve felt steep, particularly in areas related to authentication, table relations, and real-time database integration.</p>

<p>One of the more valuable concepts we explored during this course was the integration of AI tools in the development process. I leaned heavily on ChatGPT to help me navigate through the complexities of setting up and managing the database layer. From understanding how to structure tables properly to writing and debugging queries, ChatGPT served as a real time assistant when documentation alone wasn’t enough. This experience taught me not only about Supabase and backend logic, but also how to effectively use AI as a learning and problem-solving tool in real-world development scenarios.</p>
