summary: "This semester, I had the opportunity to help create a game called \"Poke the Hornet's Nest\""
---

Unity is a game engine developed by Unity technologies which is used to create 2D/3D/AR games and experiences. During this semester, I had the chance to collaborate with other students in the Game Development club to create a game.

### The Process
As with any project, starting off with a plan on something as big as creating a game requires thoughtful planning. At the beginning of the semester, there was an opportunity for students to group together and brainstorm ideas on what the game should be. Each group consisted of coders and artists so that we could bounce ideas off each from an artistic and coding perspective. The brainstorming process eventually led to a Game Pitch where each group presented their idea on which game the club should create. Since the theme for this semester was 'territorial', we each tried to center our ideas on what defines territory. There were many interesting ideas for games (The game pitch for my group was an ant simulator game). Eventually, we took a vote on the most interesting idea which was a game about a bee and wasps. 

### Fleshing out the Idea
Now that the game has been decided, we needed to expand uopn the game idea. We went through a couple more weeks to decide what direction the game should take which includes planning on mechanics, level design, art, and more. One of the aspects that we focused on more than others was the bomb throwing of the main character. Many ideas got tossed around and ended up with the idea that there would be a freezing moment of the character when they are aiming for better precision. The other aspect that we touched upon was the Queen wasp boss phases. This was one of the more complicated parts of the process since we did not want to make it too complicated because of time restraints.  

### My Task
After fleshing out the game idea, we each assigned ourselves a task on the game project. The task that I chose to take upon myself was the level design for floor 2 and Boss Phase 2. Since the level design for the game has to flow smoothly, there was a group dedicated to level design. Level design team also collaborated with the art team to figure out what kind of placement of platforms and enemies would not only be functional but visually appealing to players. Below are mockups of the level design as well as the placement of the main character and enemies.

### Overall Thoughts
Overall, this was a very fun experience and I would join this club again to learn more about game development and maybe even create a game for myself as a passion project. Creating a game requires time, collaboration, and creativity since it certainly does not happen overnight!
