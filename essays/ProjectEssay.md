## Overview

## How did you make your effort estimates?

I made my effort estimates based on a rough mental breakdown of how many components I thought each task would involve. For Issue #6 (creating the events page), I considered how much time it would take to plan the layout, structure the page using components, connect to mock data, and style the elements. I estimated 2 hours, assuming I could reuse components and copy styling from the landing page.

For Issue #18 (merging mockups into dev/main), the estimate was a team effort. We predicted 2 hours based on the assumption that we’d only have minor merge conflicts, but the reality was more complicated.

## Even though your estimates were always off, sometimes way off, was there any benefit from making effort estimates for the issues in advance?
Yes, even though the estimates were off, they helped set expectations and gave a rough baseline for how to schedule my time. For example, when I estimated only 2 hours for the events page and it ended up taking 4 hours of coding and 2 hours of non-coding tasks, I realized how easy it is to underestimate UI complexity.

Also, having estimates made it easier to prioritize the tasks with higher estimates which usually means that I needed to focus on them earlier in the week.

## Was there any benefit for tracking the actual effort expended on the issues? If so, what benefits? If not, why not? Was there any downside to estimating and tracking your effort?
Yes, tracking the actual effort helped me reflect on how much time I really spent vs. how much I thought I would. This helped me identify patterns, like underestimating time spent debugging or merging changes. It also helped our team during retrospectives because we could see where the most time was going.

There wasn’t much of a downside, the only minor inconvenience was having to remember to write down when I started and stopped. But that’s more of a habit thing.

## How did you track your actual effort? How accurate do you believe your tracking was?
I tracked my effort using a combination of sticky notes and the notes app on my phone. Whenever I sat down to work, I’d jot down the time I started and when I stopped. Sometimes I forgot to stop the timer or write it down, so I had to estimate after the fact, which definitely introduced some error.

I’d say my tracking was about 80% accurate overall which is good enough to notice trends and misalignments between estimates and reality.

## How much overhead was there in tracking your effort? Did it take up a noticeable amount of time or inhibit you working on the project?
The overhead was minimal. Once I got used to it, writing down the time felt like a natural part of starting or ending a work session. It might’ve added 1-2 minutes per session at most. It never got in the way of development or slowed me down.
