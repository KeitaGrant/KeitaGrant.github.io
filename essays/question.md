### Smart Questions: An essential skill for Students and Professionals
Throughout our academic careers, we as students often experience self doubt when forming questions, unsure whether our verbalized inquiries will lead to desired answers. This natural occurrence then continues on in professional career fields with even more complex challenges that require “Smart Questions.” The abilitiy to articulate well crafted questions is not an innate ability that we  posses, but a skill that is honed through practice and curiosity. To gain an in depth understanding of what smart questions should look like, we will analyze questions published by users on StackOverflow. StackOverflow is a platform where professionals and people and learners alike seek technical questions. The goal of this analysis is to prepare future career driven individuals such as myself to present ourselves as competent and resourcesful rather than unprepared. 

### What does a "Not so Smart Question" look like?
Growing up, we were taught that there were no such thing as a dumb question; however, in the professional setting, there are definetely questions that can be formulated better. A "not so smart" question is one that often lacks clarity. A proper header, professional use of language, and clear context on what the predicament is can greatly benefit not only the user but an expert.

#### Help Needed (A cry for help):

```
Header: How many words? Help needed
 
Description: I have this code, it's almost right: But it needs - You know 3 unique word(s)! - after it. Can someone
please help me finish this code, it's driving me crazy as I've tried everything to get it out
```

In the example above, this one displays a demanding question instead of wanting to engage with the audience. The header for this question is also very vague and unclear resulting in unattracting experts. The downvotes of the post are also very telling as people in the industry use this as a sign of unprofessionalism in the original publisher. Instead of saying "Can someone please help me finish this code," the user could have revised it as "I am unsure on how to extract exactly three unqiue words from a string in python. I tried using other methods, but I am struggling with my limited knowledge in programming. What would the best approach be?" The user also displayed unprofessional use of language such as "But it needs - You know 3..." This may be a person starting out in programming, but it indeed sounds childish. A proper header, professional use of language, and clear context was not used and as such, limited help was available.

### "Smart-ly" asked Question:
We will now analyze a "smart" question published by another user on the platform. As we observe and dissect this question, we also need to highlight the correct steps taken to appear professional. The key characterisitcs displayed in this "smart" question was a clearly defined header, prior research to asking the question, and a well formatted easy to read question.

####  Use-Strict

```
Header: What does "use strict" do in JavaScript, and what is the reasoning behind it? 

Description: Recently, I ran some of my JavaScript code through Crockford's JSLint, and it gave the following error:
Doing some searching, I realized that some people add "use strict"; into their JavaScript code. Once I added the
statement, the error stopped appearing. Unfortunately, Google did not reveal much of the history behind this string
statement. Certainly it must have something to do with how the JavaScript is interpreted by the browser, but I have
no idea what the effect would be. So what is "use strict"; all about, what does it imply, and is it still relevant?
Do any of the current browsers respond to the "use strict"; string or is it for future use?
```

The question above demonstrates several chaarcteristics of a well structured "smart" question. One of the characterisitics is a clearly defined header. A clearly defined header by the user specifies the topic and uses relevant keywords such as "use-strict", "syntax", and "javascript." Another key characteristic that the user displayed was clear context and research prior to the question. In the description, the user expressed searching on the web for for more context and expanded upon his own knowledge. Another key characteristic is that the user also made the post easy to reply to by having a well formatted easy to read question making it easier for responders to reply. This is important because there are times when users present the audience with excessive words without getting to the point. This is important so that experts are not overwhelmed and they can quickly identify the issue. Overall, the user clearly had intentions on receiving a well informed reply from an industry professional by having a clear header, prior research to asking the question, and having a well formatted easy to read question.

### Conclusion
Now that we have a better idea of "smart" and "not so smart" questions look like; it's important to keep these observations in mind as we ask our own questions as future industry professionals. A Well structured question will show to other people especially on a platform as big as StackOverflow that you are compentent enough to receive a well educated response. Now, the question that I ask readers is, are you prepared to ask “smart” questions?
