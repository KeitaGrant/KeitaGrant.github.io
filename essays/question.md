### Smart Questions: An essential skill for Students and Professionals
Throughout our academic careers, we as students often experience self doubt when forming questions, unsure whether our verbalized inquiries will lead to desired answers. This natural occurrence then continues on in professional career fields with even more complex challenges that require “Smart Questions.” The abilitiy to articulate well crafted questions is not an innate ability that we  posses, but a skill that is honed through practice and curiosity. To gain an in depth understanding of what smart questions should look like, we will analyze questions published by users on StackOverflow. StackOverflow is a platform where professionals and people and learners alike seek technical questions. The goal of this analysis is to prepare future career driven individuals such as myself to present ourselves as competent and resourcesful rather than unprepared. 

### What does a "not so smart question" look like?
Growing up, we were taught that there were no such thing as a dumb question; however, in the professional setting, there are definetely questions that can be formulated better. A "not so smart" question is one that often lacks clarity. 

#### Help Needed (A cry for help):

``
How many words? Help needed: I have this code, it's almost right: But it needs - You know 3 unique word(s)! - after it. Can someone please help me finish this code, it's driving me crazy as I've tried everything to get it out
``

In the example above, this one displays a demanding question instead of wanting to engage with the audience. The header for this question is also very vague and unclear resulting in unattracting experts. The downvotes of the post are also very telling as people in the industry use this as a sign of unprofessionalism in the original publisher.

### "Smart-ly" asked Question:
We will now analyze a "smart" question published by another user on the platform. As we observe and dissect this question, we also need to highlight the correct steps taken to appear professional.

####  Use Strict

``
Header: What does "use strict" do in JavaScript, and what is the reasoning behind it? 
Description: Recently, I ran some of my JavaScript code through Crockford's JSLint, and it gave the following error: Doing some searching, I realized that some people add "use strict"; into their JavaScript code. Once I added the statement, the error stopped appearing. Unfortunately, Google did not reveal much of the history behind this string statement. Certainly it must have something to do with how the JavaScript is interpreted by the browser, but I have no idea what the effect would be.
So what is "use strict"; all about, what does it imply, and is it still relevant?
Do any of the current browsers respond to the "use strict"; string or is it for future use?
``

### Conclusion
Now that we have a better idea of "smart" and "not so smart" questions look like, it's important to keep these reflections in mind as we ask our own questions as academic individuals. Now, the question that I ask readers is, are you prepared to ask “smart” questions?
