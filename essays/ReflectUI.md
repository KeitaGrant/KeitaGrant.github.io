### Personal Thoughts
<p> UI has become an integral part of software development. Every programming language comes with its own learning curve, regardless of the goal. Personally, I have faced many challenges when trying to create websites in the correct format. One of the biggest issues I encounter is aligning elements in their desired position. Whenever I see images or text out of place, I have the urge to just go into Photoshop and move the layer, even though web design is much more complex than that. 

Despite these challenges, I enjoy recreating websites and, through trial and error, gradually building my own. I find particular enjoyment in the artistic side of computer science, where UI frameworks allow me to focus more on design rather than spending excessive time troubleshooting layout issues. Learning frameworks like Bootstrap 5 has helped streamline this process, making it easier to bring my ideas to life.</p>

Something else that I found interesting was that receiving help from AI was not always the best option. Building websites with an artistic point of view is something that humans will always be better at doing. AI is not able to recognize what is aesthetically pleasing or not and will often create something that looks deformed and unappealing. Even though AI-generated art has been emerging, I personally believe that art will always remain a uniquely human skill, requiring creativity and subjective judgment beyond the capabilities of algorithms.


### Closing Thoughts
<p> Learning how to create a visually appealing interface is no easy feat, and the hundreds of websites that we come across daily have certainly been no simple task to build. The very website I am using now (GitHub) was likely the work of many talented developers who collaborated to create something millions of people use every day. This experience has given me a newfound appreciation for the websites I interact with regularly.

Although designing and developing websites comes with challenges and requires familiarity with a variety of tools, I find this journey to be incredibly exciting. The ability to blend artistic vision with technical implementation is what makes UI development such a fulfilling field, and I look forward to continuing my exploration of UI frameworks and beyond.</p>
