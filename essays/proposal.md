## Overview

## The Problem

Parking at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa can be extremely stressful, especially during peak hours. Students, faculty, and staff often waste valuable time circling around parking structures trying to find a spot. This is even more overwhelming for first-time parkers unfamiliar with the lot layouts, peak congestion times, or temporary lot closures due to events, holidays, or construction.

The Solution

Our proposed solution, Park-UHM!, is a web application that provides real-time parking lot availability, historical parking trends, and interactive navigation for parking lots on campus. It empowers users with smart notifications and personalized parking insights based on their parking history. This app not only eases the burden of finding parking but also introduces a user-centered approach tailored to the UH Mānoa community.

## Mockup Page Ideas

Home Page: Displays an interactive campus map with clickable parking lots.

Lot Info Page: When a user clicks a lot on the map, it expands to show peak hours, historical data, real-time availability, and a "Show More Info" button.

Login/Register Page: Allows users to create accounts and securely sign in.

User Dashboard: Displays a user’s parking history and recommended lots based on patterns.

Admin or Notification Settings Page: Lets users customize when they receive push notifications (e.g., 30 minutes before peak times).

## Use Case Ideas

A first-time student uses the map to locate available parking lots near their class and navigates directly there.

A returning commuter enables notifications and is alerted when their preferred lot is likely to fill up.

A faculty member checks upcoming construction-related closures ahead of time and changes their parking preferences accordingly.

## Beyond the Basics

Personalization: Users log in to track parking history and receive personalized suggestions based on past behavior.

Dynamic Notifications: Based on user input and real-time data, users receive alerts when lots are filling up.

Interactive Map Integration: Users can visually navigate available lots and access details at a glance.

Data-Driven Insights: Historical usage data helps predict lot availability and improve campus commuting efficiency.

## Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js, React, Bootstrap 5

Backend: Node.js (Express)

Database: PostgreSQL

Authentication: JWT or Session-based login system

Real-Time Features: WebSockets or Polling to update parking lot statuses

Deployment: GitHub Project Board for collaboration, Vercel for deployment

We believe that Park-UHM! directly addresses a major pain point for the UH community and introduces a scalable and meaningful solution. By combining real-time data, historical trends, and personalized notifications, it aims to make parking smarter and less stressful for everyone on campus.
