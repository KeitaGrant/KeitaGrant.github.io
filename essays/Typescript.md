summary: "Learning a new language can be a new endeavor, but with prior knowledge to programming, adapting can be less challeneging. Since the start of the semester, I have been learning a new language and putting my previous knowledge of programming to the test. Although I am fairly new to this language, I've had a pretty positive experience so far."

Typescript so far in my opinion has been a fun 'new' learning experience. Out of all the languages I've used up until now, I think that this is my favorite (for now). Although this may change later down the line, I enjoy the simplicity and how forgiving the programming enviornment is. This may not be the best reasoning as to why I enjoy Typescript considering that I am expected to be comfortable with various languages, but for now, I find it easy to adapt to. 

That being said, I still face many challenges, mainly because I don’t consider myself highly experienced in programming yet. Up until now, I have worked with C, C++, Java, and Python—each of which has come with its own set of difficulties. I have spent countless hours struggling through assignments, debugging errors, and refining my understanding of programming concepts. While this has helped me build a strong foundation, every new language presents a fresh learning curve.

One of my recent challenges was the first graded WOD (Workout of the Day) using TypeScript, which, unfortunately, did not go as well as I had hoped. The task was to create a function that calculates wind chill and returns specific statements based on the calculated value. At first glance, it seemed straightforward, but as I started working through the implementation, I ran into unexpected hurdles. Some of these difficulties may have stemmed from my lack of familiarity with certain TypeScript features, while others might have been a result of overcomplicating the problem.

Looking back, I believe that the pressure of coding within a time constraint significantly impacted my performance. Even though I understood the task conceptually, working under stress caused me to make mistakes that I may have otherwise avoided. Despite this setback, I see it as an opportunity for growth. Moving forward, I am determined to refine my problem-solving approach, improve my ability to work under pressure, and deepen my understanding of TypeScript. I know that setbacks are a natural part of learning, and rather than dwelling on this one, I am excited to continue exploring what makes TypeScript such a powerful and enjoyable language.
