summary: "Learning a new language can be a new endeavor, but with prior knowledge to programming, adapting can be less challeneging. Since the start of the semester, I have been learning a new language and putting my previous knowledge of programming to the test. Although I am fairly new to this language, I've had a pretty positive experience so far."

Typescript so far in my opinion has been a fun 'new' learning experience. Out of all the languages I've used up until now, I think that this is my favorite (for now). Although this may change later down the line, I enjoy the simplicity and how forgiving the programming enviornment is. This may not be the best reasoning as to why I enjoy Typescript considering that I am expected to be comfortable with various languages, but for now, I find it easy to adapt to. 

With that being said, the first graded WOD using Typescript was a blunder unfortunately. Creating a function that would calculate the wind chill and return various statements depending on the calculated wind chill. The task was to create a function that calculates the wind chill and returns specific statements depending on the calculated value. While it seemed straightforward at first, I encountered a few hurdles that caught me off guard. These hiccups might have been due to a lack of familiarity with certain Typescript features or simply overthinking the problem. Looking back on this experience, I think that coding under pressure is what set me back to not clearing the necessary requirements for full credit. Despite this setback, Iâ€™m determined to learn from the experience, improve my problem-solving approach, and continue exploring what makes Typescript so powerful and enjoyable.
