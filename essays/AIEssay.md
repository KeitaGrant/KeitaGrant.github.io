### The age of AI
<p>In current times, AI has taken over the landscape of technology and has minimized the time and effort it takes to complete menial tasks such as writing emails, making study guides, and even creating something as intimate as love letters. AI has not only taken the spotlight in this day in age for these small tasks, but has also altered the way computer science students learn and digest material. In ICS 314, AI has played a big role in helping students completing their WODS, troubleshooting problems, and assisted in suggessted ideas on improvement for assignments. </p>


### Personal Experience
<ul>
<li>Experience WODs e.g. E18:  </li>
<li>In-class Practice WODs:  I used AI for this section </li>
<li>In-class WODs: I used AI if there were errors in my line of thinking since I can't perform under pressure </li>
<li>Essays: I did not use AI to create essays since writing down your own thoughts has been becoming a lost form of art</li>
<li>Final project: I used AI for this since I am new to using databases and I was not sure how to navigate through vercel or supabase which was helpful.</li>
<li>Learning a concept / tutorial </li>
<li>Answering a question in class or in Discord: Personally, I have never used classwide Discord for answering/asking questions since I would use AI to answer my questions about anything complicated </li>
<li>Asking or answering a smart-question: I try to formulate smart questions with chatgpt to give me a specific answer </li>
<li>Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”: If I wanted a specific format to build a website then I would use AI </li>
<li>Explaining code: I used AI for this since I'd be stuck trying to figure out the purpose of a particular function.</li>
<li>Writing code: I used AI for this if I wanted to do something outside of the scope of what I know. </li>
<li>Documenting code: A lot of times AI would comment certain parts of code for the reader to better undersatand what is happening. </li>
<li>Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code code here” or “Fix the ESLint errors in code here”: I used AI heavily for this since there were too many times were I would be troubleshooting and didn't know why certain lines of code were giving errors </li>
<li>Other uses in ICS 314 not listed: I used AI in programming games since I am a beginner and have never used Unity. </li>
</ul>

#### Learning and Understanding
<p> AI has certainly chnaged the way students learn and understand material. A lot of the times, I used AI to help me understand a concept since I have not been a very strong coder to begin with. Software engineering concepts were a very foreign territory for me and the presence of AI helped me not get severely lost since the assignments over time got very complicated</p>
<p>Not only in ICS 314 specifically, but for other ICS classes as well. In ICS 311, the professor showed a trendline comparing grade statistics before the birth of ChatGPT and a graph showing grades currently. One noticeable difference was the assignment to exam grade distribution where students performed relatively similar to each evaluation component was noticebale before 2022. However, currently, with the rise of AI, the exam to assignment grade distribution has become very unbalanced as the grades for homeworks outperform exams grades by a signficant margin. This shows that students are using AI to complete assignments rather than trying to understand the concepts. </p>


### Practical Applications
<p> While AI has can be used excessively and in turn hindering learning concepts in school, there are very practical applications in using AI. AI can assist with debugging, generating boilerplate code, and providing explanations for unfamilar concepts. This can enhance productivity without pouring too much time into one task. When used responsibly, AI can be used as a supportive tool that can compliment human learning.</p>

### Challenges and Opportunities
<p> While AI can be a great tool to be used and can sometimes be used as a magic genie, AI has a lot of limitations. For instance, when creating a website, AI does not have the same human capabilities when it comes to having an artistic point of view. AI is not very good in making something 'pretty' since that concept is kind of meaningless to a computer. In past assignments where students had to recreate a website, chatgpt would just spit out random nonsense since they are not capable of recreating a design from what a human built. Even though AI is not very good at this, the jobs for software developers are in a reatively safe position since computers are not very artisitic. </p>

### Comparative Analysis
<p>Before AI and the advancement of learning tools, there were traditional teaching methods such as lectrues, textbooks, and in class exercises. These learning methods have always provided a foundational understanding to a student's eduction. However, these methods are also very rigid and can be overwhelming - especially when you have a question and don't have the ability to google the answer. With AI enhanced learning, anyone with access to the internet can be use chatGPT as an online 24/7 tutor that'll answer any question. This provides a fantastic way for students who do not have the time to go to office hours or in person tutoring to gain information on a topic even quicker and conveniently. </p>

### Future Considerations
<p>The future of AI in software engineering education holds both exciting possibilities and challenging obstacles. As AI continues to advance; it can potentially be integrated into curriculum as a learning partner. The evolution of how software engineers program will inevitably shift and having AI as a helper will become the new norm in the industry. </p>


### Conclusion
<p>AI has significantly influenced my experience in ICS 314 and beyond. It helped me stay afloat in difficult topics and guided me through unfamiliar technologies. However, I’ve also seen how it can be misused or leaned on too heavily. Through this course, I learned that AI is best viewed as a tool, not a substitute for thinking.</p>

<p>To optimize AI use in future courses, I suggest incorporating AI-literacy workshops, encouraging responsible use through reflection-based assignments, and blending AI tools with peer learning and instructor feedback. If used well, AI can help students like me not only survive software engineering, but grow confident in it.</p>
