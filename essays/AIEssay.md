### The age of AI
<p>In current times, AI has taken over the landscape of technology and has minimized the time and effort it takes to complete menial tasks such as writing emails, making study guides, and even creating something as intimate as love letters. AI has not only taken the spotlight in this day in age for these small tasks, but has also altered the way computer science students learn and digest material. In ICS 314, AI has played a big role in helping students completing their WODS, troubleshooting problems, and assisted in suggessted ideas on improvement for assignments. </p>


### Personal Experience
<ul>
<li>Experience WODs e.g. E18:  </li>
<li>In-class Practice WODs:  I used AI for this section </li>
<li>In-class WODs: I used AI if there were errors in my line of thinking since I can't perform under pressure </li>
<li>Essays: I did not use AI to create essays since writing down your own thoughts has been becoming a lost form of art</li>
<li>Final project: I used AI for this since I am new to using databases and I was not sure how to navigate through vercel or supabase which was helpful.</li>
<li>Learning a concept / tutorial </li>
<li>Answering a question in class or in Discord: Personally, I have never used classwide Discord for answering/asking questions since I would use AI to answer my questions about anything complicated </li>
<li>Asking or answering a smart-question: I try to formulate smart questions with chatgpt to give me a specific answer </li>
<li>Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”: If I wanted a specific format to build a website then I would use AI </li>
<li>Explaining code: I used AI for this since I'd be stuck trying to figure out the purpose of a particular function.</li>
<li>Writing code: I used AI for this if I wanted to do something outside of the scope of what I know. </li>
<li>Documenting code: A lot of times AI would comment certain parts of code for the reader to better undersatand what is happening. </li>
<li>Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code code here” or “Fix the ESLint errors in code here”: I used AI heavily for this since there were too many times were I would be troubleshooting and didn't know why certain lines of code were giving errors </li>
<li>Other uses in ICS 314 not listed: I used AI in programming games since I am a beginner and have never used Unity. </li>
</ul>
