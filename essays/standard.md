##### Coding Standards:

Coding standards, one of the basic requirements for any programmer pursuing as a computer scientist helps ensure code quality, uniformity, and maintenance. Without these guidelines established by industry leaders, programs that we write today would be unbearably messy and inefficient â€” not only for the person writing the program but for other people viewing it as well. In this semester, coding standards have not been strictly enforced like previous semesters, but we have been passively adapting to them   through ESLint and VSCode. Through this post, I will talk about coding standards through these two platforms and my personal experience learning to adapt to them.
