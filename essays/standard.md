### Coding Standards:

Coding standards, one of the basic requirements for any programmer pursuing as a computer scientist helps ensure code quality, uniformity, and maintenance. Without these guidelines established by industry leaders, programs that we write today would be unbearably messy and inefficient — not only for the person writing the program but for other people viewing it as well. At the beginning of this class, we were first introduced to Typescript playground to write and compile typescript code, but as we progress through the semester, we are intrdouced to new tools and software. These new tools enforce strict coding standards that the professional programming field will have us program in which is important for future programmers such as ourselves to adapt in. In this semester, coding standards have not been strictly enforced like previous semesters, but we have been passively adapting to them through ESLint and VSCode. Through this post, I will talk about coding standards through these two platforms and my personal experience learning to adapt to them.

### Transitioning to VSCode:

In my experience, VSCode has been quite unique to learn since this is my first time using this code editor. Up until now, we primarily used TypeScript Playground to test our knowledge of TypeScript in a more simplified environment. However, with the shift to VS Code, I found myself having to adjust to its more complex interface and features. 
Throughout the practice WODs that we students have been doing in class has gotten us more accustomed to navigating through the tricky interface. At the beginning, the editor was very overwhelming and there were a few times where frustrations arose since there were a lot of moving parts that took a long while to put together for it to be used in class. Despite the initial learning curve, I’ve come to appreciate its efficiency and flexibility, especially when working under pressure in a limited amount of time.


### ESLint File Extension:

ESLint, a powerful file extension of VSCode actively enforces the rules for javascript. In my experience, there have been so many messages about minor things such as proper indentation, single or double quotations around strings, creating a new line at the end of the code, and much more. I think the most jarring message would have to be creating a new line at the end of the code. 
Another common message that I often encounter is “Unsafe return of an `any` typed value.” This basically means that I would have to specifiy a return type since Typescript is not able to safely determine a return type. In this case, I would have to explicitly state one to avoid unexpected behavior.
There have been lots of wrestling with ESLint but I for the most part have been trying to appease the extension so that I do not get chunks of red lines throughout my code. This especially happened recently when I copy and pasted a file and there were a bunch of red lines from ESLint because of double quoted strings.   
Throughout having to see these messages, I’ve come to understand that many style guides enforce this for consistency and compatibility across different environments.


### Reflections on Writing Better Code:
While I am still in the process of transitioning to VS Code and ESLint; it has been a learning experience filled with both challenges and growth. At first, these tools felt overwhelming and unnecessary, but as I start to adapt, I begin to see their true value. Coding standards in any programming environment is not just there to frustrate programmers but to write clean and effective code for not only the programmer themself but for others as well. While there are still moments of frustration, I now recognize that these tools are shaping me into a better programmer. These experiences will also be helpful in stepping into the tech field for which I will thank my past self for going through the pain and suffering of learning new tools.
