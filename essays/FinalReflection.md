### Ethics in Software Engineering

<p> In this course, Iâ€™ve come to realize that software engineering isn't just about building web apps; it's about understanding the broader impact of technology on society. One concept that stood out to me was ethics in software engineering. One of the topics that we discussed in class was the use of facial recogniton in the polics force. This issue raised a lot of concerns that challenge fundamental principles of justice, privacy, and equity. While the use of software may appear to enahcne policing efficieny on the surface, its deployment can result in signifiacnt harm to vulnerable communities. </p>
<p>  This course also taught me how open source development can expand software, but also raises questions about how powerful technologies (like facial recognition) can be shared and deployed without oversight. Ethical guidelines must evolve alongside open-source contributions to ensure accountability </p>

### Agile Project Management

<p> Agile Project Management is a flexible and collaborative approach to managing projects, especially in software development. It focuses on breaking work into smaller tasks, called iterations or sprints, and delivering usable results in short cycles. During this course, I gained first-hand experience with Agile Project Management by working on a group project (Art-Hub) that was divided into three distinct milestones. Each milestone had its own set of tasks, which we tracked using GitHub issues which is a method known as Issue Driven Project Management. We used these issues to assign responsibilities, monitor progress, and ensure that every team member had a clear, manageable role. This approach helped us stay organized and flexible. </p>
