### Ethics in Software Engineering

<p>  One of the topics that we discussed in class was the use of facial recogniton in the polics force. This issue raised a lot of concerns that challenge fundamental principles of justice, privacy, and equity. While the use of software may appear to enahcne policing efficieny on the surface, its deployment can result in signifiacnt harm to vulnerable communities. </p>
<p>  This course also taught me how open source development can expand software, but also raises questions about how powerful technologies (like facial recognition) can be shared and deployed without oversight. Ethical guidelines must evolve alongside open-source contributions to ensure accountability </p>
<p> In this course, I’ve come to realize that software engineering isn't just about building web apps; it's about understanding the broader impact of technology on society. One concept that stood out to me was ethics in software engineering. There have been many events in recent years and with the birth of ChatGPT, we must not allow ourselves to create chaos even if it is unententional. By studying the historical events and creating scenarios on the impacts such as afacial recognition can prevent disaster.Since the rise of technology has been raising concerns and causing widespread fears over the unethical use of technology, we also have a duty as software engineers to uphold the moral code of ethics to prevent the collapse of society. </p>

### Agile Project Management

<p> Agile Project Management is a flexible and collaborative approach to managing projects, especially in software development. It focuses on breaking work into smaller tasks, called iterations or sprints, and delivering usable results in short cycles. During this course, I gained first-hand experience with Agile Project Management by working on a group project (Art-Hub) that was divided into three distinct milestones. Each milestone had its own set of tasks, which we tracked using GitHub issues which is a method known as Issue Driven Project Management. We used these issues to assign responsibilities, monitor progress, and ensure that every team member had a clear, manageable role. This approach helped us stay organized and flexible. </p>
<p> The timeline for the project was roughly about a month so the tasks had to be executed quickly as well as simultaneously keeping up with other classes. Even though we have dove into a bit of agile project management for the final project, we as students have always been meticulously adhering to a strict deadline of other assignments and tasks. By creating clear issue descriptions and linking them to specific milestones, our team maintained steady momentum and communication. We held brief check-ins to update each other on progress, similar to Agile stand-up meetings. This process taught me the value of accountability and adaptive planning. It also showed me how well-defined tasks and good communication can keep a project on track, even when team members have varying levels of experience and availability. 
Overall, experiencing Agile development in a hands on setting helped reinforce its practicality and importance. I can now see how Agile principles are not just theoretical—they’re applicable and extremely useful in real-world team environments, especially when working on fast paced and evolving software projects </p>

### Tying Everything Together

<p> Enrolling in this course and spending a semester gridning through this rigorous semester has been quite an experience. Topics such as design patterns, configuration management, open source software development expanded my understanding how professionally built software is built and maintained. I have only mentioned two topics that I coverred this semester, but there were so much more underlying themes that define our roles as software engineers. </p>
